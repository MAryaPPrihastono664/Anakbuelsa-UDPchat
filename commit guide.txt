Commit Message Guidelines
Write meaningful commit messages that describe what the change is about.

Common Commit Types:

feat: New feature
fix: Bug fix
docs: Documentation changes
refactor: Code improvement without adding new features
test: Adding or modifying tests
chore: Miscellaneous tasks (e.g., updating dependencies)
Use present tense and keep messages concise.

Example: "Fix login page bug," not "Fixed login page bug."
